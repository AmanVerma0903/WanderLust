# Wanderlust â€“ Travel Stay Booking Platform

Wanderlust is a full-stack web application that simulates a travel stay booking platform, allowing users to explore, list, and manage accommodation properties. Built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS, it follows the MVC architecture and features secure user authentication, dynamic routing, CRUD operations, and a responsive interface.

The project was created to strengthen practical skills in web development, with a focus on building modular backend logic, implementing RESTful APIs, handling session-based authentication using Passport.js, and managing data through Mongoose models. Server-side rendering is done via EJS, while form data is validated using Joi to ensure security and integrity.

Wanderlust demonstrates key full-stack concepts such as middleware design, schema modeling, centralized error handling, and clean, maintainable code structure all aimed at providing a real-world booking experience through a well-structured web application.
